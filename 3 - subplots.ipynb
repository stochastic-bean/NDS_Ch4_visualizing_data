It's default is to create a single (sub)plot, but we can create more subplots by passing arguments indicating the number of rows and columns of subplots we want (thinking of subplots as a 2D grid). \n",

    "For example, to create a figure with one row and two columns of subplots, we would use:\n",

Firstly, the subplots aren't square, but our *x* and *y* axes cover the same range, so ideally they would be of the same length in the plot. We can set the figure size with an additional `figsize` kwarg to `plt.subplots()`, giving it a list of `[width, height]`. Note that this specifies the width and height of the entire figure. So in the example below, since we are plotting two rows and one column, we make the height double the width:\n",
